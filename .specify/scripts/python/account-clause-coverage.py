"""Account clause and FR coverage for a feature spec, as set differences over named items.

Program-First discipline (shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md): "every contract clause
is claimed by exactly one task row" is a fixed set relation, so it is computed here once
instead of being re-asserted in prose on every run.

Two lanes, deliberately never merged into one count (FR-026) — their universes come from
different owners and so do their claimed subsets:

  clause lane   universe  every contract file under `<corpus-root>/*/contracts/`, cut into
                clause blocks by the forms the syntax owner declares
                (`shared/definitions/contract-clause-definitions.md`); per-form counts are
                owned by that spec's `notes/clause-form-census.md` and are NOT restated here
                claimed   the `[green: <contract>#<clause>]` declarations on that spec's own
                tasks.md rows, parsed by validate-tasks.py so the mention/fence rules have
                one implementation
  FR lane       universe  the `FR-nnn` definition rows of that spec's requirements.md, read
                outside fenced blocks and inline code spans
                claimed   the `(FR-nnn)` in each clause block's CITATION GROUP — the block's
                last FR/SC-bearing parenthetical — never a task row; FR is not a legal
                `[green:]` target (FR-015/FR-016)

Both lanes call the same sibling extractor, `clause_extract.py`; neither re-implements a
clause rule privately.

Checks performed:
  clause-uncovered  the clause universe minus the claimed subset, printed as a sorted name
                    list one per line with the STR-009 `UNCOVERED:` prefix; fails when any
                    item is new relative to the frozen baseline
  fr-uncovered      the FR universe minus the FRs cited from clause citation groups; fails
                    when non-empty (this lane has no baseline — see research.md A-7)
  clause-unparsable  files that yield no clause id under the owner's forms are NAMED, never
                    silently dropped, and counted into a non-zero companion; fails only for
                    a positive-form file yielding zero clauses, which is parse doubt
  coverage-baseline-delta  `comm -13 <baseline> <live uncovered>`, computed internally and
                    reported as names; fails when the delta is non-empty OR the baseline
                    file is absent — an absent baseline is never read as "no exemptions"

The anti-vacuity companion (FR-025): a green run always prints a claimed-clause count and
the scanned-file total beside the empty set, so "empty because right" is distinguishable
from "empty because blind". A corpus with no contract files at all is an input error, not a
green run.

Read-only: every verdict travels on stdout and the exit code. `--freeze` does not write
either — it PRINTS the baseline document (header plus sorted names) for the caller to
redirect, which keeps the write-point count at zero and keeps the frozen name form and the
live name form produced by one code path.

Verdict vocabulary (`status`): `ok` (both lanes empty beyond baseline, companions non-zero),
`uncovered` (at least one blocking item), `baseline-missing` (the frozen name list was not
found), `input-error` (spec dir / requirements.md / contract corpus not usable).

Exit codes:
  0  covered — no uncovered item beyond the frozen baseline, and no uncovered FR
  1  at least one blocking item in either lane
  2  input error, including a missing baseline file (C-21)

Usage:
  python3 scripts/python/account-clause-coverage.py <spec-dir-or-a-file-inside-it>
  python3 scripts/python/account-clause-coverage.py --spec-dir DIR [--corpus-root DIR]
                                                    [--baseline PATH] [--json] [--list-named]
  python3 scripts/python/account-clause-coverage.py DIR --freeze > DIR/coverage-baseline.txt

Freeze the baseline at the FIRST full-tree accounting run, not the first green one: green
would require the baseline while the baseline requires a run, which is circular (C-21).
The frozen面 excludes the spec being accounted, so that spec's own items can be claimed but
never exempted by its own baseline. Comparison is by NAME set, never by count — the same
`comm -13` idiom the frozen test baseline uses, and for the same reason: a count difference
cannot tell new debt from retired debt.

The external idiom MUST run under `LC_ALL=C`. The names are codepoint-sorted (Python's
`sorted`), while glibc collation ignores `#`, `/` and `.` at the first level, so under a
UTF-8 locale `comm` reports the baseline as unsorted and then echoes all of it as the delta
— measured on the real corpus as 665 where the true delta was 182. The internal delta is a
set difference and is locale-independent, so it stays authoritative; `LC_ALL=C` is what
makes the external cross-check agree with it.
