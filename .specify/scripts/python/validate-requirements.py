"""validate-requirements.py — deterministic checker for a `requirements.md` artifact.

Program-First discipline (shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md): the propositions checked
here are fixed, textual and decidable, so a program judges them and prints a verdict; an
agent MUST NOT re-derive them by reading the artifact and declaring a result.

Checks (this enumeration IS the pinned label set — the house pin extracts it from this
docstring with `^  ([A-Za-z][A-Za-z-]*)\\s{2,}`, so the two-space indent and the gap of at
least two spaces before each description are load-bearing, not cosmetic):
  id-contiguous   FR- and SC- definition ids each form one gapless sequence, per prefix and
                  never across prefixes; a zero-padding inconsistency (`FR-7` beside
                  `FR-007`) or a letter suffix (`FR-003a`) is a FORMAT violation and is
                  named as written — it is never normalized away, because normalizing hides
                  the author's numbering intent
  doc-order       definition rows appear in ascending numeric order. Anchored on DEFINITION
                  lines only, never on every id occurrence: cross-references legitimately
                  appear out of order, and anchoring on occurrences reports false violations
                  on a clean spec. The `## Clarifications` section is excluded for the same
                  reason — it is append-only history that quotes rows from before a
                  renumbering. BOTH anchors are load-bearing.
  ref-resolvable  every FR-nnn / SC-nnn / [[STR-nnn]] reference outside a code span resolves
                  to a definition; the STR check is bidirectional (a defined string nobody
                  cites is reported too); a Shared Strings `Consumed by` cell is
                  reverse-consistent with the rows it names
  marker-count    counts ACTIVE clarification markers — the colon is inside the pattern and a
                  backtick prefix is excluded, so a spec that merely discusses the marker is
                  not counted as carrying one
  dup-id          an id defined twice is an error, reported separately from ref-resolvable:
                  the two have opposite remedies (delete one, or add the missing definition)

Skeleton criterion (checker-form C-12 — a semantic judgement, so it is written down here
rather than left to the reader): an artifact is skeleton-only when a requirement row still
carries an uppercase bracketed placeholder such as [SPEC], [REQUIREMENT NAME], [PLACEHOLDER],
[DATE], [REQUIREMENTS_KEY], [FEATURE_ID] or [FEATURE_NAME]. That state is reported as a fourth
`status` value; it does NOT get a fourth exit code.

Exit codes: 0 = no error (warnings allowed) / 1 = at least one error / 2 = file missing,
unparsable, or no content lines. Read-only: this script has no write point of any kind.
