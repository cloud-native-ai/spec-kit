"""Run Determination engine (运行判定) for Spec Kit.

One completed run reaches wrap-up; this engine evaluates four measured
quantities for it — token 消耗, 耗时, 制品正确性 and 满意度 — and emits exactly
one ``run_determination`` record. The record *is* the 改点 (owner:
``.specify/memory/glossary.md`` → `改点`): an observation sensor inside the
improve flow, never a feedback entry and never an intervention ledger.

Program-First (``shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md`` § 程序优先) is the whole
reason this file exists: every fixed-rule judgment below — source-hierarchy
resolution, name-level set difference, literal-substring evidence search, the
satisfaction decision table, the trigger conjunction — is computed here, and the
model supplies only the coarse classifications it is the sole competent judge of
(``--complexity``, ``--qualification``, ``--user-turn-class``,
``--unresolved-red``). Summary-First (§ 摘要优先) binds the read side: this
engine reads originals freely and emits projections only.

Ownership (``shared/guidelines/one-source-of-truth.md``, tier 1 = code). This
module is the code-side owner of the ``run_determination`` record schema and of
every value domain the program branches on. The design-time owner of the four
quantities' 判定口径, the three lanes' read surfaces, the two consumption points
and the SI-4 routing conclusion is the dated S1 record at
``.specify/teams/.work/session-driven-self-improvement/outputs/judgment-contract.md``,
which migrates those facts to the landed framework surfaces named in its header
block and MUST NOT be cited as current reality afterwards.

Deliberately reached by reference, never restated here:

* Exit codes — the house table, owned by the ``EXIT_*`` constants shared across
  ``scripts/python/`` engines and by STR-007 in
  ``.specify/specs/053-machine-decidable-artifacts/requirements.md`` § Shared
  Strings. One code never carries two meanings across actions of this binary.
* ``not_evaluated`` and the comparison words — owned by STR-004 (same file) and
  ``shared/workflow/self-improvement-workflow.md`` SI-8.
* The four feedback red lines and the never-solicit line — owned by
  ``shared/workflow/feedback-step.md`` § Positioning & Red Lines.
* The name-level baseline form, red-first evidence, mutation drill and the
  anti-vacuity sentinel — owned by ``.specify/memory/glossary.md``.
* Which agent CLIs have a resolvable session store, and which do not — owned by
  ``STORE_RESOLVERS`` / ``UNSUPPORTED_TOOL_HINTS`` in
  ``scripts/python/history-utils.py``.
* The memory store's layout, entry format and index — owned by
  ``scripts/python/memory-utils.py``, which is the only writer this engine uses.
* The evidence store's run layout and freshness gate — owned by
  ``scripts/python/evidence-utils.py``.
* ``should_prompt`` and its threshold — owned by ``scripts/python/feedback-utils.py``.
  This engine composes with it and never re-implements it.

Hard separation from 情境评估 (Situational Assessment, owner
``shared/guidelines/proactive-trigger.md``): the two are structural siblings with
disjoint jobs. This engine writes no per-turn row, adds no situation or signal
vocabulary, and never calls that engine.

Actions:
  determine   write one record for the run that just reached wrap-up; also
              settles the latest unsettled record of the same unit when
              --prev-user-turn-class is supplied
  settle      amend the satisfaction axis of one already-persisted record
  history     read-only projection of past records (never record bodies)

No aggregate score exists in this engine and none may be added: a scalar roll-up
is rejected by ``shared/guidelines/fast-fail.md`` § 范围限制 and by the B2
adjudication in ``.specify/teams/session-driven-self-improvement/team.md``.
The only roll-up is the boolean ``passive_trigger.trigger_feedback``.

Zero network. Stdlib only. No interactive surface of any kind.

#: ``regressed`` would state a fact nobody measured, and would make "new failure"
