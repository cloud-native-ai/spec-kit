# Feature Detail: Unify Command Handoffs

**Feature ID**: 001  
**Name**: Unify Command Handoffs  
**Description**: Provide a single, consistent way to describe command prerequisites and next steps across usage docs and command templates.  
**Status**: Planned  
**Created**: 2026-02-03  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-03

## Overview

This feature improves Spec Kit’s documentation-driven workflow by making command sequencing explicit. It adds a clear, centralized description of command relationships in the usage guide, and ensures every command template consistently documents what should come before and what should happen next.

## Latest Review

Initial requirements drafted and validated. Implementation pending.

## Key Changes

1. Add an explicit command-relationship summary to the usage guide.
2. Standardize `handoffs` frontmatter format across all command templates.
3. Standardize the in-body “next steps / handoffs” guidance across all command templates.
4. Ensure read-only commands provide guidance without implying automatic edits.
5. Align core workflow path and optional branches (clarify/checklist/analyze/research) across docs.

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain a single canonical guidance mechanism: `handoffs` in frontmatter plus a consistent in-body section.
- Keep documentation guidance consistent with the existing workflow diagram and command semantics.
- Changes are documentation/template-only; they must not alter actual CLI/agent behavior.

## Future Evolution Suggestions

- Consider generating the usage relationship table from templates’ `handoffs` to prevent drift.
- Add a lightweight lint/check that validates YAML frontmatter formatting and required fields.
- Extend relationship guidance to include “common failure modes” and recovery paths per command.
