# Project Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
[Brief summary of what the LLM need to know, key information about project and its core value proposition]

> **Note**: This file is generated by `/speckit.instructions`. Custom content is preserved during updates.

## Documentation Map
This project documentation is distributed across several key files. You MUST refer to these documents for specific details:

| Document | Location | Purpose | Key Content |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Constitution** | `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Single source of truth for principles | Coding standards, architectural rules, constraints |
| **Feature Index** | `.specify/memory/features.md` | Feature roadmap status | List of project features |
| **Development** | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Setup and Guidelines | Setup, testing, and pull request guidelines |
| **Readme** | `README.md` or `README` | basic information of project | {TODO} |
| **Project Documents** | `docs/` | High-level architecture | Architecture and design documentation |
| [Other Doc] | [Path] | [Purpose] | [Summary] |

> **Directive**: When answering questions or generating code, ALWAYS check the relevant document from the map above first.

## Fact, Correctness & Logic Checks (Input Sanity)
User-provided context can be wrong (misconceptions), incomplete, or contain typos. Before acting on user input, perform a basic sanity check to avoid propagating errors.

Minimum checks:
- **Names & identifiers**: Verify file paths, module/package names, commands, and symbols exist in the repo. If uncertain, search the workspace rather than guessing.
- **Factual claims**: Treat user statements as hypotheses; confirm against the repo (code/config), the Documentation Map, or authoritative references.
- **Logical consistency**: Detect contradictions between requirements, constraints, and desired outcomes (e.g., incompatible versions, mutually exclusive goals).
- **Typos & near-misses**: Correct obvious typos (paths, flags, option names) and explicitly state the corrected interpretation.
- **Assumptions**: If you must assume, keep assumptions minimal, label them clearly, and prefer reversible changes.

Escalation rules:
- If the suspected error impacts correctness, security, data loss, or large refactors: **pause and ask a clarifying question**.
- If the issue is low-risk and the fix is obvious: proceed with the correction and mention it briefly.

# Tool And Skills Usage Guide

> **Note**: Tool and Skills details are injected into prompts by the agent when needed. This section is guidance only.

## Suggested Tooling Scope (High-Level)
- System/Linux CLI and shell context (env vars, functions, aliases)
- Project scripts (Shell/Python) when available
- MCP tools and skills (auto-injected; avoid duplicating details here)

## Guidance
- Prefer project scripts for repeatable tasks.
- Use MCP tools for internal docs or code queries when available.
- Verify architectural rules via the **Constitution** rather than assumptions.

## Tools
Project specific tools documentation can be found in `.ai/tools/`.
- [MCP Tools](.ai/tools/mcp.md)
- [System Tools](.ai/tools/system.md)
- [Shell Tools](.ai/tools/shell.md)
- [Project Scripts](.ai/tools/project.md)

## Skills
Project specific skills documentation can be found in `.github/skills/`.
