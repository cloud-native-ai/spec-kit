# Tool And Skills Usage Guide

> **Note**: Tool and Skills details are injected into prompts by the agent when needed. This section is guidance only.

## Suggested Tooling Scope (High-Level)
- System/Linux CLI and shell context (env vars, functions, aliases)
- Project scripts (Shell/Python) when available
- MCP tools and skills (auto-injected; avoid duplicating details here)

## Guidance
- Prefer project scripts for repeatable tasks.
- Use MCP tools for internal docs or code queries when available.
- Verify architectural rules via the **Constitution** rather than assumptions.
