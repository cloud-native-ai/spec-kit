# Feature Detail: Python Tool Stack

**Feature ID**: 003  
**Name**: Python Tool Stack  
**Description**: Adoption of modern Python ecosystem for development and runtime.  
**Status**: Implemented  
**Created**: 2026-01-18  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-18

## Overview

Use of Python 3.8+, Typer, Rich, and Hatchling ensures a robust, maintainable, and developer-friendly codebase. This non-functional feature defines the technical standard for the project.

## Latest Review

Stack is defined in `pyproject.toml` and currently in use.

## Key Changes

1. Dependency management via `pyproject.toml`.
2. Use of `rich` for formatted terminal output.
3. Use of `typer` for declarative CLI building.
4. `truststore` for secure certificate handling.

## Implementation Notes

- Strict typing recommendations.
- Usage of `hatchling` as build backend.
- Python 3.8 compatibility required (though 3.11+ recommended for dev).

## Future Evolution Suggestions

- Upgrade to strict Python 3.12+ features when environment allows.
- Integration with `uv` for faster resolution (already suggested in docs).
