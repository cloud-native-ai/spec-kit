**Status**: Implemented  
**Created**: 2026-01-18

## Overview

Provides the prompt engineering and template infrastructure that enables AI agents (Copilot, etc.) to act as SDD facilitators. It defines the flow from `specify` to `plan`, `tasks`, and finally `implement`.

## Latest Review

Templates for specs, plans, and tasks are in place and operational in the repository.

## Key Changes

1. `speckit.specify` prompt flows.
2. `speckit.plan` architecture derivation.
3. `speckit.implement` coding execution.
4. `speckit.constitution` for project governance.

## Implementation Notes

- Relies on markdown templates in `templates/`.
- Prompt instructions stored in `.github/prompts/`.
- Assumes Agent capabilities for file manipulation.

## Future Evolution Suggestions

- Support more LLM backends via CLI integration.
- Automated validation of spec-to-code compliance.
