# Feature 001: Feature Mechanism Redesign

**Feature ID**: 001  
**Name**: Feature Mechanism Redesign  
**Description**: 重新设计feature相关机制，将feature索引和详细信息分离存储  
**Status**: Planned  
**Spec Path**: .specify/specs/001-feature-mechanism-redesign/spec.md  
**Created**: 2025-11-21  
**Last Updated**: 2025-11-21  

## Overview

This feature redesigns the feature management mechanism in the Spec Kit project. The new design separates the feature index from detailed feature information:

- **Feature Index**: Stored in `memory/feature-index.md` as a centralized table of contents
- **Feature Details**: Each feature has its own detailed file in `memory/features/${FEATURE_ID}.md`

## Key Changes

1. Rename `memory/features.md` to `memory/feature-index.md`
2. Create `memory/features/` directory for individual feature detail files
3. Implement automatic feature ID assignment (sequential three-digit numbers)
4. Update all related scripts and workflows to support the new structure
5. Maintain backward compatibility with existing specifications

## Implementation Notes

- Feature IDs must be sequential three-digit numbers (001, 002, etc.)
- Feature detail files must be named `${FEATURE_ID}.md`
- The feature index must be automatically updated when features are created/modified
- All placeholder tokens in templates must be properly resolved
- Existing specification workflows should continue to function without modification
