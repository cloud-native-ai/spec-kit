"""Deterministic structural validator for a feature's tasks.md.

Program-First discipline (shared/guidelines/token-efficiency.md): the fixed
mechanical rules that /speckit.tasks must enforce are checked here, once,
instead of being re-improvised as ad-hoc greps on every run.

Checks performed:
  row-format      every task row matches `- [state] T<NNN>[letter] ...` on ONE
                  line; checkbox lines with a missing/placeholder/malformed ID
                  are errors; indented continuation lines directly after a task
                  row (a wrapped row) are errors
  id-unique       task IDs are unique across the file
  blockedBy       every [blockedBy: Txxx,Tyyy] reference resolves to an
                  existing task ID (dangling/self references are errors;
                  references to LATER tasks are warnings)
  parallel-safe   two [P] tasks in the same phase must not WRITE the same file
                  path (warning: path extraction from prose is heuristic, and a
                  row's paths are split into write targets and pointer targets —
                  a path governed by an explicit read-only marker (a cite
                  governor such as `per` / `see` / `against` / `owner` / `指向`,
                  `read-only`, or a `grep` / `diff -` probe in the preceding
                  window) is a pointer target, so two rows that merely cite the
                  same owner do not conflict. Confirm each reported overlap
                  against the rows' actual write targets, then drop [P] from one
                  row or re-target it — never silence a warning by deleting the
                  cited path from the row text)
  story-labels    inside a `## Phase ... User Story ...` phase every row
                  carries exactly one [US<n>] label; NON-story phases
                  (Setup / Foundational / Polish / anything else) carry zero
                  `[US` markers (placeholders like [US-none] are violations)
  dod-format      no checkbox-syntax line (`- [ ]` / `- [x]` ...) inside the
                  `## Definition of Done` section (reserved for task rows)
  green-dangling  a `[green: <contract>#<clause>]` attribution whose contract
                  file does not exist, whose file declares no machine-decidable
                  clause form, or whose clause id that file does not contain
                  (error: a claim nobody can resolve is a claim nobody can
                  honour, which is worse than one that lands a phase late)
  green-cross-phase  on one contract, the clause ordinals of the claims run
                  backwards against the rows' monotonic order, so the earlier row
                  cannot leave that contract green at its own phase (warning;
                  compares the same `order` counter blockedBy uses — this script
                  has no numeric phase index and MUST NOT grow one)
  green-clause-collision  two rows claim the same contract clause, i.e. the
                  clause partition (条款分区 (Clause Partition),
                  `.specify/memory/glossary.md`) was cut over the same clause
                  twice (warning)
  green-path-divergence  one TEST path is claimed green by two rows at two
                  different green points, so the pair cannot each be the row that
                  turns that file green (warning; scoped to test paths because an
                  append-only sink such as an evidence log is written by every row
                  that pastes into it and is nobody's green point)

Usage:
  python3 scripts/python/validate-tasks.py <path/to/tasks.md> [--json]

Exit codes:
  0  no errors (warnings may still be reported)
  1  at least one error
  2  file missing / unreadable / no task rows found
