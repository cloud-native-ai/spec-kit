# Project Instructions for AI Agents

## Project Overview
Spec Kit is an open source toolkit that allows you to focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes instead of vibe coding every piece from scratch.

## Documentation Map
This project documentation is distributed across several key files. You MUST refer to these documents for specific details:

| Document | Location | Purpose | Key Content |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Constitution** | `.specify/memory/constitution.md` | Single source of truth for principles | Coding standards, architectural rules, constraints |
| **Feature Index** | `.specify/memory/features.md` | Feature roadmap status | List of active/planned/implemented features |
| **Development** | `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Setup and Guidelines | Setup, testing, and pull request guidelines |
| **Architecture** | `docs/index.md` | High-level architecture | Architecture and design documentation |
| **Skills** | `docs/skills/spec.md` | Skills Documentation | Guide to using and creating skills |

> **Directive**: When answering questions or generating code, ALWAYS check the relevant document from the map above first.

# Tool And Skills Usage Guide

> **Note**: Tool and Skills details are injected into prompts by the agent when needed. This section is guidance only.

## Suggested Tooling Scope (High-Level)
- System/Linux CLI and shell context (env vars, functions, aliases)
- Project scripts (Shell/Python) when available
- MCP tools and skills (auto-injected; avoid duplicating details here)

## Guidance
- Prefer project scripts for repeatable tasks.
- Use MCP tools for internal docs or code queries when available.
- Verify architectural rules via the **Constitution** rather than assumptions.
