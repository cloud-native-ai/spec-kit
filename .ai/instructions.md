## Project Overview
**Spec Kit (spec-kit)** is an open source toolkit designed to facilitate **Specification-Driven Development (SDD)**. It helps developers focus on product scenarios and predictable outcomes by providing a structured workflow from requirements to implementation. Key features include AI agent integration (GitHub Copilot, Qwen Code, etc.), a skill system for extensibility, and strict adherence to project constitution.

# Tool And Skills Usage Guide

> **Note**: Tool and Skills details are injected into prompts by the agent when needed. This section is guidance only.

## Suggested Tooling Scope (High-Level)
- System/Linux CLI and shell context (env vars, functions, aliases)
- Project scripts (Shell/Python) when available
- MCP tools and skills (auto-injected; avoid duplicating details here)

## Guidance
- Prefer project scripts for repeatable tasks.
- Use MCP tools for internal docs or code queries when available.
- Verify architectural rules via the **Constitution** rather than assumptions.
- **Shell Functions**: Common functions (like `json_escape` in `profile.d/04_format.sh`) are defined in `cws-lib-bash`. Before implementing a new shell function, search `$CWS_LIB_BASH_HOME`.
